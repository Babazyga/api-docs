<!---

This template applies to documents aimed at finishing a certain task, for example, a quickstart guide, basic features, and advanced features.


The title describes a task that you want to do. For example: *Implement step-up authentication*.
For docs published on dev portal, the doc title is configured in the internal cms.
To write a page, use the style and tone suggest in the style guide.

--->

# Describe what is to be done

<!---

Explain why the content is relevant and what the user will achieve.
Use "page" at the top of a document and "section" wherever else.
For example:

--->

Step-up authentication provides a higher level of assurance that a person is who they claim to be. When a user tries to perform a task, they are challenged to produce additional forms of authentication. In this case, when a user who is already logged into your app tries to connect to a highly secure conference, the back-end system sends a one-time sms-code to a registered mobile device which the user enters in your app.

This page shows you how to add this feature to you app.

## How it works

<!----

A helicopter view that explains the architecture and workflow that the user is implementing.

For example:

--->

To _achieve the task outlined in the Title_ you use _these technologies_ that _work in the following way_.

<!---

Add an architecture diagram, workflow diagram, animation, screenshot here.

For example:

--->

The following figure shows the callflow between the different elements you use to implement step-up-authentication for Agoras:

TBD

<!---

Add a concise but complete explanation of the task. Where needed, link to a trusted source.

--->

## What you need

<!---

List what the reader needs to know, as well as packages or SDKS that must be available, to successfully work through the tutorial. Keep the list short, but be sure to include language and concepts the reader should be familiar with.

*IMPORTANT*: The first prerequisite will always include a link to the _“Get Started with Agora”_ tutorial using URL: https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms.

For example:

--->

To successfully understand and complete this task you must have the following:

- A valid Monite account.
- A monite key/value pair.
- Good knowledge of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication[Multi-factor authentication].

## Setup 

<!---

Describe the steps to create a new project and set up the environment. For example,
- Create a xxx project
- Necessary configurations
- Create the UI

*IF NONE ARE NEEDED, REMOVE THIS SECTION*

For example:

--->

To create the environment necessary to *TITLE OF THIS PAGE*:

1. Do this.
1. Do that.
1. Do something else.

<!---

Markup commands to run in the terminal as `code`.

If you need a specific file structure, do it as a text diagram:
For example:

<environment_root> \
├── index.html \
├── scripts \
│ └── script.js \
└── styles \
│ └── style.css

--->

## Implement &lt;A rewording of the page title&gt;

<!---

The title for the steps does not have to be implemen t.

If there are multiple logical sections in the procedure such as back-end and frond-end, use subsections. The goal is to modularize the various elements and build the project in a logical way that makes it easy for the user to follow along.

Write an intro sentence to explain the subsections:

For example:

--->

Step-up authentication implementation involves changes to components in your app and security infrastructure. This section shows you how to:

- [Implement &lt;module1 in procedure&gt;](link to module1)
- [Implement &lt;module2 in procedure&gt;](link to module2)

<!---

If there are no locical subsections, write a single procedure here.

--->

### Implement &lt;module1 in procedure&gt;

<!---

A module explains how to implement a set of functions that operate together to produce a specific feature of the project.
Be sure to explain all inputs and outputs (not necessarity a complete API reference), discuss their significance within the code and how they work together.


```javascript 
 code blocks 
 Always remember to put the coding language
```

For example:

--->

To add step-up-authentication to your app:

1. Do this.
1. Do that:
   1. Sometimes you need substeps.
   1. Always at least 2 substeps.
1. Do something else.

### Build &lt;module2 in procedure&gt;

<!---

Brief explanation about what the technology does in this section, then a procedure.

For example:

--->

To add step-up-authentication to your security infrastructure:

1. Do this.
1. Do that:
    1. Sometimes you need substeps.
    1. Always at least 2 substeps.
1. Do something else.

## Test &lt;A rewording of the page title&gt;

To ensure that you have implemented &lt;A rewording of the page title&gt; correctly:

1. Do this.
1. Do that:
    1. Sometimes you need substeps.
    1. Always at least 2 substeps.
1. Do something else.


## Reference

<!---

If there is reference information you want to share with the user, add it here. If not, remove this section.

For example:

--->

You use the following to configure or develop &lt;TITLE&gt;:

| Name        | Default           | Type  | Description |
| ------- |:---:| -----:| :-------------:|
|shakespeare |playwright |job |Set `shakespeare` to `poet` to enable the sonnet writing feature for this instance. Possible values are: <ul><li>`actor` - someone who pretends to be someone else while performing in a film, play, or television or radio programme.</li><li>`director` - a person who is in charge of a film or play and tells the actors how to play their parts.</li><li> `impresario` - a person who arranges different types of public entertainment, such as theatre, musical, and dance events.</li><li> `playwright` - a person who writes plays.</li><li> `poet` - a person who writes poems.</li></uls>
